/**
 * This is the abstract implementation of ResourceAdapter interface. All the
 * transport adapter classes must extend this class. The default implementation
 * does not provides any functionality except capturing the application server's
 * facilities provided via BootStrapContext. Especially, the WorkManager,
 * XATerminator and Timer references are obtained from this BootStrapContext
 * that should be assigned to local variables.
 * 
 * It is a standard not to create any threads in adapters. Instead it is
 * recommended to use the Work Management contract to create Work instances
 * (which are java threads in its own right) and submit to application server
 * for execution. Application server will create/obtain a new or free thread to
 * execute the Work instance. As these Work instances are managed by the
 * application server, greater control is exhibited.
 * 
 * The Timer facility is used to execute the Work instances in a scheduled
 * manner. If your application doens't have a consumer that sits and waits for
 * the incoming messages, but you do have a requirement of looping through
 * indefinitely, take use of Timer facility.
 * 
 * The XATerminator is used by the EIS to complete/recover the transactions that
 * are initiated by the EIS. Usually the XATerminator instance could be same as
 * the TransactionManager.
 * 
 * All the extending classes such as FileResourceAdapter, JMSResourceAdapter etc
 * must implement endpointActivation, endDeactivation and getXAResources
 * methods.
