  <title>Design Diagram</title>

  <para>
    The logical design diagram is the first step in creating a <emphasis>Module</emphasis>. 
    It doesn't have to be perfect or complete (sometimes extra details come out as
    you think more deeply about components) but it should always include:

  <itemizedlist>

      <para>What the source(s) of your <emphasis>Events</emphasis> are.</para>

      <para>What the destination(s) for your <emphasis>Events</emphasis> are.</para>

    <title>EIP Notation</title>

    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Notation is very important with these diagrams.</emphasis> 
      You should always attempt to use the notation provided by the industry standard book 
      - <emphasis>Enterprise Integration Patterns</emphasis> by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf 
      (ISBN-10: 0321200683, ISBN-13: 978-0321200686). In fact, if you do not own this book 
      then do yourself a favour and get it! You'll find that a vast majority of IT professionals 
      involved in the EIP space use the terminology and patterns found within.
