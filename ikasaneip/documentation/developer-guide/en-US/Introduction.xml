  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This guide will take you through the development process of creating
  an Ikasan EIP <emphasis>Module</emphasis>. The demonstration
  <emphasis>Module</emphasis> we are building is a Pricing Service and its
  source code can be found under <filename
  class="directory">${basedir}/samples/TODO</filename></para>

  <section>
    <title>High Level Business Logic</title>

    <para>From a business perspective, the Pricing Service will: <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Pick up a <filename>prices.csv</filename> file that contains
          price data for currency exchange.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Route the data contained in that CSV file based on TODO to
          different destinations for processing.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist></para>

  <section>
    <title>Order of Development</title>

    <para>In short, the best way to build an Ikasan EIP
    <emphasis>Module</emphasis> is from a <emphasis role="bold">top down,
    Test-driven approach</emphasis>. The typical order of development for a
    <emphasis>Module</emphasis> is as follows:</para>
