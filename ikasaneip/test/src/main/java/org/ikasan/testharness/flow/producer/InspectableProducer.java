/**
 * Dummy producer to test last messages/events in unit tests.
 * <p>
 * It can be used with or without an actual {@link IkasanJmsTemplate} setup. If you want to use it with a
 * {@link IkasanJmsTemplate} simple provide the instance of the template in constructor (directly or in Spring config)
 * and provide "configuration" and "configuredResourceId" parameters.
 * <p>
 * Useful for unit tests by providing a Spring config that will override the original producer with this implementation,
 * so that you can check the persisted messages by calling the {@link #getEvents()} and {@link #getEventCount()} methods.
