# Ikasan Visualisation Dashboard Security - Policy Management
The 'Policy Management' screen provides the ability for users to be able to view and administer all 'Policies' within Ikasan. From this screen users can perform the following tasks:
- Assign 'Policies' to 'Roles'

## Viewing Policies
The 'Policy' search view can be navigated to from the left hand menu in the Ikasan dashboard. This view provides sortable and filterable grid containing all 'Policies'. It is not possible to remove a 'Policy' as these are fixed Ikasan entities.
