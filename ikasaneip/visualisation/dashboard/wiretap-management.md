# Ikasan Visualisation Dashboard Wiretap Management

A wiretap represents an EAI concept in which data events can be captured for the purpose of testing, monitoring or troubleshooting. Ikasan 
supports dynamic wiretaps that can be added to a flow of data, at runtime, from within the Ikasan Dashboard. Wiretaps are added and removed 
from within the visualisation screens within the dashboard.
 
Ikasan supports 2 different kinds of wiretaps. 
- <img src="../../developer/docs/quickstart-images/wiretap.png" width="100px" align="left"> Indexed wiretaps that are written to Ikasan's underlying text index, which can subsequently be searched for in the Ikasan Dashboard.
<br/>
<br/> 
- <img src="../../developer/docs/quickstart-images/log-wiretap.png" width="100px" align="left">Log wiretaps that record the data event in the module log file that the wiretap was added to.
<br/>
<br/> 
<img src="../../developer/docs/quickstart-images/wiretap-icons.png" width="200px" align="left">Wiretaps are added to components and can be added 'BEFORE' or 'AFTER' the component. Icons appear along side the component with those
appearing to the left of the component, denoting a wiretap 'BEFORE' the component execution, and those to the right denoting a wiretap 'AFTER' the component execution.
