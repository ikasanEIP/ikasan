# Ikasan Visualisation Dashboard Security - Role Management
The 'Role Management' screen provides the ability for users to be able to view and administer all 'Roles' within Ikasan. From this screen users can perform the following tasks:
- Add and remove 'Roles'
- Assign and unassign 'Roles' to/from 'Users' and 'Groups'
- Assign and unassign 'Policies' to/from 'Roles'
- Assign and unassign 'Integration Modules' to/from 'Roles'

## Viewing Groups
The 'Role' search view can be navigated to from the left hand menu in the Ikasan dashboard. This view provides sortable and filterable grid containing all 'Roles'. From this screen users can remove 'Roles' by clicking on the trash can icon in the grid.
