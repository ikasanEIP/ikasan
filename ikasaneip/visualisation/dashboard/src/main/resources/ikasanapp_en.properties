help.search=It is possible to search for events within Ikasan. These events can be narrowed by date and time as well as a search term. It is also possible to filter and sort the search results for each column in the search results table. 
help.search-solr-special-characters=If your search term contains any of the following special characters + - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : / you will need to escape the special character using \\. For example if you are searching for 02:03 your search term will be 02\\:03. 
help.search-whitespace=The search term can contain whitespaces.
help.search-wildcard=The search term supports wildcard searches using the * wildcard character. For example if a document contains the word IKASAN, a search of IKA will not return any results. However using the wildcard character, IKA* will return all results that contain the word IKASAN. *KASA* will also return all results containing IKASAN.
help.search-logic=The search term supports logical operators AND, OR and NOT along with () in order to have nested logical constructs. The individual search terms must be surrounded by quotation marks. For example a search term of "ACME" AND "INC" will return all documents that contain both ACME and INC in the document. Whereas a search term of "ACME" OR "INC" will return all documents containing either ACME or INC. A search term of "ACME" NOT "INC" will return all documents that contain ACME and do not contain INC.
help.search-wiretap=Ikasan allows for events to be collected and inspected, as they flow through the Ikasan flows. This is known as a wiretapped event. In order to search for Wiretap events make sure that the Wiretap icon is selected. Wiretap events are captured with a time stamp with millisecond precision along with the location of where the wiretap was triggered. They are also captured with a life identifier that remains immutable for the data event for its entire journey throughout the bus, even if the underlying data mutates. The correlating elements of the wiretap build a full chronological picture of the flow of data.
help.search-replay=Flows can be configured to record events as they are received by the consumer of the flow. Once data events have been recorded, they can then be replayed back into the flow from which they were recorded, in either the same environment that they were recorded, or into another environment in which the same module/flow is deployed. In order to search replay events make sure that the replay icon is selected.
help.search-error=It is possible to search for errors that have occurred within an Ikasan flow. Errors within Ikasan are broadly categorised into to two types of errors. Firstly, there are technical errors. Technical errors are considered to be transient, and as such when one occurs, Ikasan will log the error to the error reporting component of the Hospital Service and then will rollback and attempt process the message again. Ikasan can be configured to retry a fixed number of times or indefinitely. If configured to retry for a fixed number of times, Ikasan, upon exhausting the number of retries, will stop the processing flow, flag it into an error state, and notify the monitoring service of the error that has occurred. In order to search error events make sure that the error icon is selected.
help.search-hospital=It is possible to search for events that have been excluded from an Ikasan flow. The user is able to remediate the error by resubmitting messages that have been excluded. Errors within Ikasan are broadly categorised into to two types of errors. The second broad categorisation of errors within Ikasan, are those that are considered business errors. Business errors typically occur when an Ikasan module is unable to process a message that it has received, perhaps dues to missing static data, or due to an XML validation issue. Generally business errors are deemed to be repairable. With this in mind Ikasan excludes messages associated with business exceptions. By selecting the hospital icon, it is possible to search for excluded events. Ikasan users are then able to resubmit the excluded messages once the underlying business exception has been remediated. Alternatively users can choose to ignore excluded message. In order to search excluded events make sure that the hospital icon is selected.
