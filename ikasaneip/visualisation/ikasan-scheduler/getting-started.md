# Ikasan Enterprise Scheduler - Getting Started
The Ikasan Enterprise Scheduler provides enterprise grade scheduling services. An enterprise scheduler is a software tool or system that helps manage and automate the scheduling of tasks, 
processes, or events within a large organization or enterprise. It coordinates and organizes various activities, resources, and dependencies to ensure that tasks are executed efficiently 
and on time. The Ikasan Enterprise Scheduler provides a centralized platform for creating, managing, and monitoring schedules across different departments or teams within an organization.

The key functions of an enterprise scheduler include creating and editing schedules, defining dependencies and relationships between tasks, allocating resources, setting priorities, 
and assigning tasks to appropriate team members. It may also incorporate features such as notifications, alerts, and reporting to keep stakeholders informed about the progress and 
status of scheduled activities.

The Ikasan Enterprise Scheduler plays a critical role in optimizing workflow efficiency, reducing manual effort, improving coordination among teams, and ensuring that tasks are completed in a 
timely and organized manner. It is a powerful tool that helps businesses efficiently manage their resources, optimize scheduling processes, and ensure smooth operations across the organization.

To monitor job statuses, the Ikasan Enterprise Scheduler receives realtime job events from agents whose role it is to execute scheduled jobs within a business domain. The scheduler also uses 
notifications or alerts to inform relevant stakeholders about changes in job status. External teams can also query job and job plan statuses via services exposed by the Ikasan Enterprise Scheduler.

The job status can be represented by different states, such as "queued," "running," "completed," or "error," and the scheduler keeps track of these states for each job. When a job is queued, 
it means it is waiting to be executed. When it is running, it means it is currently being processed. When it is completed, it means it has finished successfully, and when it has failed, it 
means it encountered an error or issue during execution.

The Ikasan Enterprise Scheduler also provides additional information related to the job, such as the job's start time, end time, duration, and any relevant output or error messages. This information 
provides system operators and developers.
