# Ikasan Enterprise Scheduler - Core Data Model
The core data model is broken in 3 distinct logical areas. Firstly there are the data models for jobs that are executed by the Ikasan Enterprise Scheduler.
Secondly there is the job plan data model which defines how all of the jobs in the job plan relate to one another. And lastly
there is the data model that represents running instances of the job plans.
