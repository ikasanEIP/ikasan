/**
 * This class is a Transformer that acts on incoming <code>Payload</code>s within an <code>Event</code> and transforms
 * the content to XML based on the supplied XMLReader instance.
 * <p>
 * This is a copy transform working off of the SAX call backs on the reader to provide an output XML.
 * </p>
 * <b>NOTE: This is not a stylesheet transformer.</b> This implementation is notable for the following reasons:
 * <p>
 * 1) It is intended to be thread safe with respect to the underlying <code>javax.xml.transform.Transformer</code> as a
 * new instance is created every time the business method (onEvent) is called.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 2) Its intended use is to transform non-xml <code>Payload</code>s to XML through the configuration of a content
 * specific <code>XMLReader</code>. e.g. an <code>XMLReader</code> implementation capable of reading fixed length flat
 * files can be injected on construction thus allowing flat file (fixed length) payloads to be transformed to XML.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 3) Rather than relying on the default <code>ErrorListener</code> this transformer supplies its own implementation
 * designed to propagate the exceptions thrown for parse time errors and warnings
 * </p>
