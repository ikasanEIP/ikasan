# Introduction
Ikasan's data requirements can be considered as follows:
* Long lived data that provides features to the platform such as security and module control.
* Long lived data that provides features that enable to platform to describe itself.
* Long lived data that provides configuration parameters for Ikasan components.
* Transient data that is captured on the wire, by each module, as Ikasan modules perform their role as participants in the broader ESB topology.
* Aggregated long lived data data captured on the wire, as Ikasan modules perform their role as participants in the broader ESB topology, indexed and available for fast contextual searching.
