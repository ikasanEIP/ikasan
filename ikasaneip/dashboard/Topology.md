## Topology

The ‘Topology View’ exposes a view onto the underlying integration elements that form the Enterprise Service Bus. The users ability to access individual tabs is driven by the roles that the user has. It provides the following functional areas:
- [Topology Tree](./TopologyTree.md). The topology tree provides a hierarchical view on all the servers, integration modules, flows, and component elements and provides functionality to allow for the control and administration of these elements.
- [Wiretaps Tab](./TopologyWiretapTab.md). The wiretaps tab allows a user to search for data that has flowed through the ESB, which has been wiretapped at relevant points within a flow. The tab provides the ability to filter the results based on criteria defined by the user. Users can drill down on details of wiretapped events.    
- [Errors Tab](./TopologyErrorTab.md). The errors tab exposes errors that have occurred within the ESB. These errors can be filtered based on criteria defined by the user. Users can drill down on details of the error.
- [Exclusions Tab](./TopologyExclusionTab.md). The exclusions tab provides the user with access to events that have been excluded by the ESB. Exclusions typically occur when a business exception has occurred, for example due to missing reference data. Business exceptions are distinctly separate to technical exceptions which are normally transient. For technical exceptions, the ESB will attempt to self-recover and as such these events do not need to be excluded because once the underlying issue is resolved, the data will flow as normal. However,  business exceptions are excluded which allows for the root cause to be remediated, for example reference data fixed, and the data subsequently resubmitted into the ESB to flow to its intended destination. This tab allows the user to drill down into details of the excluded data, the error that caused it and provides functionality to allow the user to action the exclusion.
- [Actioned Exclusions Tab](./TopologyActionExclusionTab.md). The actioned exclusion tab provides an audit view of exclusions that have been actioned.
- [System Event Tab](./TopologySystemEventTab.md). The system event tab provides a view on system level events that have occurred within the ESB. These events include flow startup control events, mapping changes, dashboard and module access, and user security permission changes to name a few.
- [Categorised Errors Tab](./TopologyCategorisedErrorTab.md). The categorised errors tab provides a view on all errors that have been deemed categorised errors. The user can drill down on details and action if applicable.
