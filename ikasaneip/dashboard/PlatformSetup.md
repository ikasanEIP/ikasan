## Platform Setup

If you are setting up Ikasan for the first time, you will be required to go through the platform setup step prior to accessing the dashboard. This screen is accessed by clicking on the setup link on the right hand side of the ‘Navigation Bar’ at the top of the screen. 
 
You will then be presented with a dialog in which you must enter the ‘admin’ user password that will be used during the initial setup. 
 		

Once you have entered the user password press the save button. This action will then perform the task of creating the required database tables and populating the database with the data required for the dashboard to become operational. Once this is complete you will successfully be able to log into the application as described above. The credentials for the initial login are username ‘admin’ along with the password entered for the administration user in the setup step.
The next logical step in setting up the application in an enterprise context is to setup a user directory (LDAP) and synchronise this application with this directory. The Managing User Directories section of this document outlines the steps required to do this in more detail. However the dashboard is now fully operational for the admin user that has been created.
