Open Source Enterprise Integration Platform

The Ikasan Enterprise Integration Platform (EIP) addresses the problem 
domain most commonly known as Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). 

Enterprise application integration can be, and already has been, 
approached a number of different ways by a number of projects/vendors, 
both Open Source and closed commercial frameworks. 

It is the intention of the Ikasan Enterprise Integration Platform 
to address this domain as commoditised configurable solutions rather 
than another development framework.
