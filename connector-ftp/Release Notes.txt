Release Notes
=============
The following TLAs are used:-
NBC - Not Backward Compatible with previous version of the framework.

Release 1.2.11
--------------------
 - externalised hibernate session factory properties
 - updated dependency on connector-basefiletransfer to 1.2.6
 - updated dependency on connector-base to 1.1.8

Release 1.2.10
--------------------
 - added sonatype repository distribution management in the pom.xml
 
Release 1.2.10
--------------------
 - Port to SF.
 - Bumped dependent project versions up to official releases as follows,
   ikasan-common-1.1.12
   ikasan-connector-base-1.1.7
   ikasan-connector-basefiletransfer-1.2.5
   

Release 1.2.9
--------------------
 - FTPManagedConnectionFactory logger.info changed logger.debug to reduce log noise.
 - FTPConnectionImpl changed to ensure we do not try to sort empty ClientListEntry lists.
 - FTPConnectionImpl was trying to chronologically sort an empty file list. Check implemented to ensure list is not empty prior to sort.
 - Adding socket and data timeout to connection to connection spec. Default values are 0 ms (infinite).
 
Release 1.2.8
--------------------
 - Bug Fix: Apache recommends using completePendingCommand() after storeFileStream(). This causes issues with
 printWorkingDirectory returning 'null' if not called. To fix this the stream writing has moved from the DeliverFileCommand
 into the FileTransferProtocolClient implementation as we should not be changing the FileTransferClient interface - this fix is private to this client.

 - Provide default Boolean and Integer values to the ConnectionSpec rather than null values. 
Clients do not then have to override all members of the Spec

 - Adding a socket connection timeout value to the connection spec.
 
 - Instead of specifying the local port, bind socket to 0 (will be determined at runtime)
 
 - Remove local ports range
 
 - Ignoring BindExceptions: the connector will attempt to bind to a local port for 0xFFFF times before giving up.
