Release 1.2.4
--------------------
 - HibernateBaseFileTransferDaoImpl logger.info changed to logger.debug to reduce log noise.

Release 1.2.3
--------------------
 - AbstractBaseFileTransferTransactionalResourceCommand and HibernateBaseFileTransferDaoImpl logger.info changed logger.debug to reduce log noise.

 - Bug Fix: Apache recommends using completePendingCommand() after storeFileStream(). This causes issues with
 printWorkingDirectory returning 'null' if not called. To fix this the stream writing has moved from the DeliverFileCommand
 into the FileTransferClient implementation as we should not be changing the FileTransferClient interface - this fix is private to this client.
