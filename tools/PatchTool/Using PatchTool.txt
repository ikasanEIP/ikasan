Things you need
---------------

1) Install Ant
2) Install AntContrib

3) Know what/where your profile is

What is a profile? A profile is a set of patches that will be applied to some known starting point, to create the final product that you need. A profile will exist in a profile file, that is itself a piece of ant script.

Example contents:

<project>
    <path id="testServer">
        <pathelement location="patches/removeEjbTimerPersistence.patch"/>
    </path>

</project>

This defines the profile 'testServer', that contains just a single patch. The path to the patch file here is relative to where you are running ant from.


4) Know where your template is

This is our starting point. This is the thing that will not change, but will be copied and patched to create the final product.

5) Know where your target should go

This is the final product. This needs to be a directory (not yet existing) inside an already existing location


6) Run the build.xml ant script, specifying all the variables required. Eg.

ant -DprofileFile=/home/ross/PatchTool/profiles/testProfile.xml -DtemplateDir=/home/ross/tools/jboss-4.2.3.GA/server/default -DtargetDir=/home/ross/tools/jboss-4.2.3.GA/server/testServer -DprofileName=testServer applyPatchProfile


You should now see the 'testServer' created as a copy of the 'default' (which remains untouched), and patched with the patch 'removeEjbTimerPersistence.patch'
