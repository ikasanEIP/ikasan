Release 1.2.5
--------------------
 - Provide default Boolean and Integer values to the ConnectionSpec rather than null values.

 - Adding a socket connection timeout value to the connection spec.
 
 - Instead of specifying the local port, bind socket to 0 (will be determined at runtime)
 
 - Remove local ports range
 
 - Ignoring BindExceptions: the connector will attempt to bind to a local port for 0xFFFF times before giving up.
