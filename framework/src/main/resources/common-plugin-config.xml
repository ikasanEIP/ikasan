		This XML defines any configuration common to all configured plugins and invokers
		
		At time of writing, this included the basic template configuration for the sequential
		invoker. ie The sequential invoker is declared, with reference to a List of plugins
		intended to be invoked in sequence. The pluginSequence at this level is simply left empty,
		as it is intended that configurations that include this file, will override this.
		
		Note that the configuration here allows the sequentialInvoker to be configured with any
		pluginSequence that is supplied later by a configuration that includes this file
